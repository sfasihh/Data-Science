solving a simple linear regression problem


Solving a linear regression problem using the Gradient Descent algorithm. This program utilizes an already built dataset containing student marks where final marks are dependent on midterm marks. This application uses this dataset to create a linear regression model which helps detect the final mark based on the midterm mark.
